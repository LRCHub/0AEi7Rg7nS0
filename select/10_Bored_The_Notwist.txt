We make love and take bodies
Got nothing to do
Sell ourselves and we look away
Got nothing to do

We are bored
Always bored
We are bored
We're always bored

We use to moon leave our neighbour
Got nothing to do
We make love and we turn away
Got nothing to say

We are bored
Always bored
We are bored
We're always bored

Don't ask for our feelings
Cause we've got nothing to say

Don't ask for our future
Cause we've got nothing to do
