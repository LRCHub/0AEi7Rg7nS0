I'm making a list, of who shouldn't exist
And everyone's name, is at the top of my list

Run, motherfucker, run and hide
Nothing you can do to save your life
Staring at a noose in front of you
Wrapped around your neck until
You're cold and blue

And I've got an obsession, with Smith and Wesson,
Yeah, yeah
Got a bullet and a trigger
And a target on your head
Right between the eyes you're better off dead

Bored 'til death, nothing to lose
Gonna put a motherfucking bullet in you
Sick of your lies and all of your shit
The thought of you living just makes me

I'm making a list, and checking it twice
Gonna find out, who's naughty or nice

Run, motherfucker, run and hide
Nothing you can do to save your life
Staring at a noose in front of you
Wrapped around your neck until...
