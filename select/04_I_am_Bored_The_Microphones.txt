I AM BORED
You tore a hole so deep
my leak poured out torrentially
but now I’m bored.
My bloody flow has slowed
so I can be bored near you.
Oh what a loss!
It didn’t show its head
‘til mine was torn and thrown at you
and back it grew
with glassy eyes locked in contact
on the couch with you,
a boring face.
We’re losing touch.
I reached and my extended
hand went through.
Now we both know what we have to do.
